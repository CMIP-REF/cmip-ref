The `solve` cli command now accepts a `--timeout` argument which can be used to specify the maximum time in seconds that the solver should run.
If the solver does not finish within the specified time, it will be terminated.
The default timeout is 60 seconds. The `--timeout` argument can be used like this:

```bash
ref solve --timeout 120
```
