The REF now uses absolute paths throughout the application.

This removes the need for a `config.paths.data` directory and the `config.paths.allow_out_of_tree_datasets` configuration option.
This will enable more flexibility about where input datasets are ingested from.
Using absolute paths everywhere does add a requirement that datasets are available via the same paths for all nodes/container that may run the REF.
