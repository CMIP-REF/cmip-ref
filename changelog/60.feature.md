Adds a `cmip-ref-celery` package to the REF that provides a Celery task queue.

Celery is a distributed task queue that allows you to run tasks asynchronously.
This package will be used as a test bed for running the REF in a distributed environment,
as it can be deployed locally using docker containers.
