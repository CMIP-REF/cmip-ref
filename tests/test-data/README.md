# Test data

## Sample Data

A set of sample data that can be used to test the REF.
These data are used in the REF tests and are not intended to be used for any other purpose
as they are downsampled to reduce the size of the test dataset.

These data can be fetched using `make fetch-test-data`.
This will remove any exisiting sample data.


## CMEC Output

Reference output from the CMEC model is stored in the `cmec-output` directory.
